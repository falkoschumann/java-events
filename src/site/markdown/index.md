Events
------

The common event mechanism in Java for messaging are event listeners and events.
This needs a listener interface, an event class and a lot of boiler plate code
for adding and remove listeners and firing events.

The same boiler plate code is needed for implements Bean Properties. Java FX
introduce new property classes to reduce this boiler plate code.

This library will reduce the boiler plate code for event messaging. It is easier
than the Java FX event mechanism. The Java FX events are designed for UI events.
The events in this library are much more easier to use, because there are
designed for common use with all plain old Java objects (POJOs).


### Usage

General instructions on how to use events can be found on the
[usage page](usage.html).
